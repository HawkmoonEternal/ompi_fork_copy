MPI_T_init_thread \- Initializes the MPI Tool information interface
.SH SYNTAX

\f[C]

.SH INPUT PARAMETERS
.IP \[bu] 2
required: Desired level of thread support (integer).
.SH OUTPUT PARAMETERS
.IP \[bu] 2
provided: Available level of thread support (integer).
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]MPI_T_init_thread()\f[] initializes the MPI tool information
interface.
Calls to MPI tool functions are allowed at any point in execution
(including before \f[C]MPI_Init()\f[] and after \f[C]MPI_Finalize()\f[])
as long as \f[C]MPI_T_init_thread()\f[] has been called at least once
and the number of calls to \f[C]MPI_T_init_thread()\f[] is greater than
the number of calls to \f[C]MPI_T_finalize()\f[].
If at any point in execution the number of calls to
\f[C]MPI_T_finalize()\f[] equals the number of calls to
\f[C]MPI_T_init_thread()\f[] the MPI tool interface will no longer be
available until another call to \f[C]MPI_T_init_thread()\f[].
.PP
\f[C]MPI_T_init_thread()\f[], like \f[C]MPI_Init_thread()\f[], has a
provision to request a certain level of thread support in
\f[C]required\f[]:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]MPI_THREAD_SINGLE\f[]: Only one thread will execute.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED\f[]: If the process is multithreaded, only the
thread that called \f[C]MPI_Init_thread()\f[] will make MPI calls.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]MPI_THREAD_SERIALIZED\f[]: If the process is multithreaded, only
one thread will make MPI library calls at one time.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE\f[]: If the process is multithreaded, multiple
threads may call MPI at once with no restrictions.
.PP
The level of thread support available to the program is set in
\f[C]provided\f[].
In Open MPI, the value is dependent on how the library was configured
and built.
Note that there is no guarantee that \f[C]provided\f[] will be greater
than or equal to \f[C]required\f[].
.SH NOTES
.PP
It is the caller's responsibility to check the value of
\f[C]provided\f[], as it may be less than what was requested in
\f[C]required\f[].
.SH ERRORS
.PP
\f[C]MPI_T_init_thread()\f[] will fail if:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]MPI_T_ERR_MEMORY\f[]: Out of memory
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]MPI_T_ERR_CANNOT_INIT\f[]: Interface not in the state to be
initialized
